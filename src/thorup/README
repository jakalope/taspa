1. OVERVIEW
The files in this directory implement the following shortest path algorithms:

BFS, Dijkstra's, Goldberg*, Thorup

The Goldberg implementation is essentially Dijkstra's with a bucket priority-queue and the ``caliber heuristic.''

When possible, there is a directed and undirected variant of each (notably, Thorup only works in the undirected case).  The Thorup algorithm does not handle zero-length edges, although it could easily be modified to ``collapse'' vertices connected by zero length edges into the same vertex.  

In addition, several utility codes exist -- counting sort, kruskal MST, timer, unionfind, etc.  I have tried to give credit in the comments of files.


This code is accompanied by my undergraduate thesis, available on my website at http://paul.rutgers.edu/~crobakj/  

2. BUILDING / COMPILING
type ``make depend; make"

The file format used is the famous DIMACS format.  for an example, see thesis_ex.into
